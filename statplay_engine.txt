This is the general informational document, I suppose. My (Eebit's) random musings on how to implement various things will go here.

===

- X-Gauge: Stored as Integer with a max of 30
- Calculate half levels with % operator 
--- even is a full X-Level, odd is a half X-Level


For CellBank:
    - "classification": 0 for Empty Cells, 1 for Object Cells, 2 for Unit Cells.
    - "has-stats": is how we decide whether stats get displayed during "display information" (more later)
    - perhaps color and id fields can be concatenated for determining different cells, in the event that more than one cell uses the same identifier

GameState:
    - Contains: 
        - a grid, 
        - the current phase (double; (<turn number>, <<team id>'s phase>)),
        - the action stack (for reversing / undoing movements and actions)?,
        - victory state,
        - defeat state,
    -

Example State (Recursion, 1.1):
wwsssssww
w-DsssI-b
w^--A--vw
w^-----vw
w^-----vw
w^-----vw
w^-----vw
w^-YJ--vw
b--TES--w

Convention: 
CAPS 		for units 
lowercase 	for Cells 
- 			for empty Cells
{1-9}*		for Starting Zones


Classes:
GameState
Grid
Cell
Inflictionary


Globally-Defined Object Behaviours:
- Walls (w)
- Starting Zones (#: {1-9}*)

===

Methods:
displayRange() // may only be needed when GUI version is created?
    -
getAdjacentCells()
    - get current cell from 2d array grid
    - +/- 1 to current cell's x and y
    - get those cells and add to a list
    - return list
    - if array goes oob, do not add to list

===

Placement Phase:
- Left Click to place (set isPlaced to TRUE)
- Right Click to remove (set isPlaced to FALSE)
- Left + Right Arrow Keys to cycle through available units to place
- Variable to keep track of MAX_PARTY_SIZE

===

(Store units + positions as a dict?)

{
    "team-id": 1,
    
    units: [
        "Y": "H4",
        "J": "H5",
        "T": "I4",
        "E": "I5",
        "S": "I6"
    ]
}

* Need to colour console output
* Numbers appear in placement phase (Phase 0) only
** Turn into Empty Cells after Phase 0

>Select a unit's identifier, or type "end" to complete your phase
    // check if cell's / unit's alignment == currentphase[team]
    // if true, return display information and go to available actions
    // if false, return display information and go to "select unit's identifier..."


user input> Y
    // get input char
    // look up position
    // decode position into tuple
    // print(cell-name + " ({" + cell-id + "}) selected")
    // print line break
    // display information based on type of cell -- unit, object, empty...
